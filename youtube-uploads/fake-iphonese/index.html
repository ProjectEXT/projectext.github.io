<p>I buy a lot of stuff on eBay, most of the time items I think I can flip &amp; make some money, or simply just want to keep around or actually use. So when I saw this listing for an iPhone SE with little-to-no description on what specs are inside starting at $1, I couldn&rsquo;t resist. (It did get up to $20 because some other dude tried outbidding me but I wasn&rsquo;t letting that happen shh). I always try to be safe rather than sorry when buying on eBay, so I decided to run the devices IMEI through a check before placing a bid, and it came up to be a 64gb model that wasn&rsquo;t iCloud Locked.</p>
<h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2>
<p>Lets start with the unboxing. Immediately, I noticed something looks funky with the home button design on the front of the box. It seems to be indented, pressed in, which isn&rsquo;t like the design on an authentic box. The box also didn&rsquo;t want to close right, but maybe the seller packaged the item odd.</p>
<p>Now that I have my hands on this thing, we can see that the box says its a 16gb model. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to match what comes up with the IMEI. That could just be this website though, as this other one I found says its supposed to be 16gb so who knows anymore. At this point i decided to get my official 2016 SE box to compare the two. It&rsquo;s almost immediately obvious something sketchy is going on when comparing the two side by side.</p>
<p>Finally opening the box, the seller nicely left a piece of Styrofoam to protect the screen. Putting that to the side though, all of the accessories inside the box give an even stronger feeling that this is either non-authentic or something funky is going on. I mean come on, neither the font or the direction the flip on the paper-tab matches Apple&rsquo;s original.</p>
<h2 id="the-device">The device</h2>
<p>Looking at the phone itself, its condition doesn&rsquo;t match what the seller had listed, showing multiple scratches, dents, and even a air gap in the screen causing it to pop up &amp; down when pushing on it. The biggest eye-catcher, or finger catcher I should say, is the apple logo. It&rsquo;s not flush with the case like every other iPhone on this planet. You can actually get your nail under the logo, like somebody carved the logo out of the casing. This device could&rsquo;ve had an LED Apple logo mod done to it at some point?</p>
<p>Powering up the device &amp; going through the initial setup, everything seemed to be working fine. I jammed out to some old classics to test the speakers, yup everything&rsquo;s good.</p>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>Time for some teardown, well more like little extremos forgetting how to take apart an iPhone. Nothing looked off to me when looking inside, it looked too good to be true if anything, so much so that I wanted to see if the battery with the apple logo was legit or not, seeing as 3Utools says it&rsquo;s only been charged 5 times. Rubbing at the logo with a q-tip &amp; some isopropyl alcohol, the logo wouldn&rsquo;t come off so it&rsquo;s&hellip; legit? Somebody feel free to let me know in the video comments.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After putting the device back together &amp; putting everything back in its box, I decided to contact the seller about what I&rsquo;ve discovered. When requesting for a return, the seller gave a full refund without even wanting the item back&hellip; so they must&rsquo;ve known what they were selling.</p>
<p>Before writing this script, I was going to add a joke about how I at least got a working iPhone SE out of this, but now the screen is having some ghost-touches, locking the screen and stuff. I also tested the headphone jack, it&rsquo;s alright if you enjoy bass.. and only bass. It&rsquo;s safe to say this phone is not the happiest to be alive. At the end of the day, this video should be used to show that not everything you see on eBay is exactly like it&rsquo;s description, even if the seller has good or really good reviews like my seller did.</p>
