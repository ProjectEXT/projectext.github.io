<p>Good morning. I wasn&rsquo;t going to do this video, feeling it was very basic and little helpful for anyone else out there when it comes to the topic of ad blocks etc. But I decided hey, if it helps one other person, then my time wasn&rsquo;t wasted.</p>
<p>Nobody likes ads, which is why most of us use an ad-blocker when we watch youtube and simply whitelist the channels we want to watch ads on to appreciate their work. Well, nowadays more youtubers are adding sponsors and ads inside of their video, basically defeating the purpose of saving time watching ads. There is a real easy solution, and it works exactly like an ad-blocker. Lets get into it.</p>
<p>Being just like an ad-block extension, its a simple plugin for your browser. To download, head over to their website and click the install button, as easy as that. If you&rsquo;re someone like me that doesn&rsquo;t trust the every random browser extension suggested to me, it does seem they are open-source so you can swift through their code til your hearts content.</p>
<p>This plugin can do more than just skipping sponsor spots in a youtube video as well, including things like Unpaid/self-promotions, Exclusive access, Intros/Credits, Preview/Recaps, Tangents etc. There&rsquo;s a butt ton of more customization to this plugin that you can do, feel free to look more into it yourself after this video. How can it do all of this, it&rsquo;s not like this is an advanced AI or anything? All submissions for skipping this content are done by other viewers using this plugin, meaning each one is done by hand and can easily be added or removed, including yourself being eligible for adding/removing.</p>
<p>Is using something like this ethical? Well, that&rsquo;s a topic I can make a whole video about. Linus from LTT recently spoke about this plugin, asking for viewers to at least give them a chance to offer sponsors to them, and that they&rsquo;re made to be easily skippable. For a channel like that, you can use the extensions whitelist mode, so you don&rsquo;t block any sponsors for their channel if you feel that&rsquo;s necessary &amp; just have any content-creator that&rsquo;s snobby with them on the block list. There, issue fixed! Well, not completely but enough for this video.</p>
