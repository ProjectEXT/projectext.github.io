<p>I&rsquo;ve been reluctant to make this video because I&rsquo;m slower than your sex life on Tuesdays, but I had to reinstall Windows recently which also means I have to reinstall BetterDiscord. With that said, this video will show you the basics of how to install BetterDiscord &amp; what plugins I recommend are basically a necessity.</p>
<p>Start by heading to BetterDiscord&rsquo;s <a href="https://betterdiscord.app">official website</a>. All links will be in the video description as well. Click the big blue download button, and open the launcher. Before continuing farther, make sure you understand that BetterDiscord is against TOS and could lead to an account ban, but that&rsquo;s very rare so long as you have a brain cell. After choosing install, click on the version of discord you have, which is likely the top option. From there, your discord application will close and reopen to a popup showing that your installation process has worked. If you do not get one, check your settings and see if you have new options at the bottom of the list. If you do not, repeat the first couple steps.</p>
<p>Cool! Now you have BetterDiscord, what do you do? Well, the point of this is obviously to have more freedom over what the application can do. Most people want it for custom themes &amp; plugins, so lets start there. There is two plugins that I recommend are a must. I will also have them in the description, but on their website locate under the plugins tab, &ldquo;<a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/PluginRepo">pluginrepo</a>&rdquo;. After downloading the javascript file, find the plugins tab in the discord app and press the &ldquo;open plugins folder&rdquo; button. Drag the file into the folder and you&rsquo;ll notice it popup in the plugins menu. enable it, and bam your good to go. if it asks you to install additional plugins or libraries, often times you want to hit yes because they are necessary for it to work properly. Now, you can browse all of the plugins available directly in your discord application! The last plugin everybody should have installed is &ldquo;<a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ThemeRepo">themerepo</a>&rdquo; this does exactly what you think, so I don&rsquo;t have to explain that.</p>
<p>And with all of that done, that&rsquo;s all you need to install BetterDiscord! There are a few plugins that I use on a daily basis that I recommend you should use too.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is the most popular of the bunch, being &ldquo;<a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ShowHiddenChannels">showhiddenchannels</a>&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t allow you to read channels you don&rsquo;t have access to, but you can see the names of them and even see users in a voice channel.</li>
<li><a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/JoinedAtDate">JoinedAtDate</a> and <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/CreationDate">CreationDate</a> - Displays the creationdate of an account when clicked onto one &amp; the date that user joined the server you&rsquo;re currently selected on.<br>
Lastly, <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/SplitLargeMessages">splitlargemessages</a> and <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/TypingIndicator">typing indicator</a> - I use these so I can send longer messages &amp; see when others are typing in a channel that I may not be clicked on. I don&rsquo;t have a demonstration on recording, but you can try it out for yourself.</li>
</ul>
