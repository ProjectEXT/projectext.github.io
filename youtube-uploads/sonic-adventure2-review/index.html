<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sonic adventure 2 was born &amp; released on June 19, 2001 in NA, making this game almost old enough to drink. Quick disclaimer, this video isn&rsquo;t anything like a review, I won&rsquo;t be going in depth about its gameplay or anything like that. With that out of the way, lets talk about what this game holds &amp; how it holds up in 2021.</p>
<p>Sonic Adventure 2 is kind of known to be one of the best 3D sonic games, which doesn&rsquo;t say much for the rest of the series. I first played this game when I was like 4, and it was the GameCube version. I LOVED this game. I didn&rsquo;t know what the hell I was doing, but I knew there were these eggs that if I YEETED across the map, a weird looking baby thing would pop out.</p>
<p>Years later, I&rsquo;m bored scrolling through steam &amp; see both the game &amp; its DLC which we&rsquo;ll talk more about later in the video, were on sale for around $3.50 all-together. Knowing me, I wanted to relive my childhood. Now that I&rsquo;m not a cute lil baby anymore &amp; I&rsquo;m an ugly dumbass that acts like an aging nanny from the nursing home, the &ldquo;polish&rdquo;, if you can call it that, has rubbed off just a tad.</p>
<h2 id="performance-issues--bugs-galore">Performance Issues &amp; Bugs Galore</h2>
<p>Just trying to open the game with default settings, the game will crash. Every time. Yeah, turns out you can&rsquo;t open the game with fullscreen enabled. When getting into the game, something seemed wrong with the first cutscene, but I didn&rsquo;t notice what it was until I got into the gameplay itself.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Even though the settings claim to be 2560x1440 @ 60fps, its actually running at native 144hz. This game was built around the time in-game sequences &amp; events were based around the amount of frames the game will be played at. If you don&rsquo;t understand what I mean, I will leave a video in the description better explaining. This explains why cutscenes were COMPLETELY Broken at times. Because of this game mechanic, everything I do in the game will be sped up way more than the game is meant to be played.</p>
<p>The solution to fixing this problem isn&rsquo;t difficult, just annoying. You have to limit the frame counter to 60fps through Nvidia&rsquo;s control panel, adding the game as a program &amp; tinkering with its settings in there. Don&rsquo;t ask me what you&rsquo;d have to do if you didn&rsquo;t have a nvidia card, god speed. Changing this setting, the game ran fine afterword&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Finishing up playing for the night, I tried playing the game the next morning and noticed my controller was no longer working. It&rsquo;s always fun sitting around, reading through a dozen articles on reddit trying to find a solution, just to see that the game launcher decided to switch my default controller input to keyboard. Thanks.</p>
<h2 id="dlc">DLC</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk about the story or characters, as I&rsquo;m not a sonic fanatic &amp; haven&rsquo;t completed it fully just yet. I do plan to though, so if you want to see a review of such please lemme know in the comments below. I WILL however, talk about how the only DLC for this game is literally to allow you to have your &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; fight eachother to the death&hellip; or at least to the end. It&rsquo;s Karate fights that can level up your &ldquo;creatures&rdquo; &amp; show off what you&rsquo;ve turned them into. According to steam, it adds six new characters, and 21 additional 2 player maps but nobody cares, we&rsquo;re here for the CPS Violations!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having widescreen is nice, and playing at 60fps over 30fps is the dream, I think leaving this game in the past &amp; with lil baby me would&rsquo;ve been the better way to go. The game&rsquo;s littered with classic bugs here and there, but that would be apart of the story &amp; i&rsquo;m not reviewing that in this video. Anyways, (outro). Apparently my Sister watches my videos now&hellip;. this one will be hard to explain. PEACE!</p>
