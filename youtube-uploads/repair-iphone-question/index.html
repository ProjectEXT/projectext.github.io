<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Should you is a question too many people ask before even considering why they&rsquo;re asking. But for some it feels impossible to get anywhere without asking, so I&rsquo;m here today to hopefully answer your questions about whether its worth your time fixing older devices on your own, especially if you don&rsquo;t plan to update them to the latest OS version.</p>
<h2 id="ebay-listing">eBay Listing</h2>
<p>I bought this iPhone SE around November last year, and the only issue with the device was the screen. The digitizer was coming apart from the entire casing, and the home button ribbon was ripped. The listing didn&rsquo;t state anything about a ripped home button ribbon cable, so I decided to be the bitch I am and request a refund. So, now we have a free device! I wanted to make a seperate video about this device without repairing the screen, but couldn&rsquo;t jailbreak without the home button, so I had to bite the bullet. Spending about $15 for the screen and $3 for a replacement home button (free shipping on both), items arrived only 3 days later. Time for repairing.</p>
<p>The repair took me just under one hour. I had some difficulty with the speaker at top, because the screen didn&rsquo;t have the hole needed for it. I think its because they accidently sent a 5s screen, but last I knew they were compatible with each other. Who knows.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is It Worth It?</h2>
<p>Is it worth spending the money to fix a device like this? Well, if we add the price of replacement parts &amp; time it took, it&rsquo;s around $18 in parts and one hour of your time. We aren&rsquo;t factoring in the time it takes to obtain a broken device, because that could happen randomly just like my case. A perfectly working iPhone SE with this amount of storage around the time of purchase was $60-$90, which is much more than what I paid for. Now fair, the touch ID doesn&rsquo;t work, but a device with this issue goes for around $50-$60. Crazy, right? If you have the guts to spend time with the device and not just hand it off to an expensive phone repair store that doesn&rsquo;t care about your items, then you get good returns. And hey, if you break it, you didn&rsquo;t lose anything, and learned your way around fixing devices more. If someone like me that just got out of Highschool and is self-taught with everything tech, you can do it too. The more you do something, the more you get in return.</p>
