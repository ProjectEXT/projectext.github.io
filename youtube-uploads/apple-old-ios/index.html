<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Something useful to know before watching, Awhile back, Apple was reportedly slowing down older iPhone&rsquo;s for reasons they claimed to save battery health &amp; were eventually fined for doing this. If you haven&rsquo;t heard anything about this, you should google up some articles about it before watching this video, because then whats coming up will make more sense.</p>
<h2 id="ios-15--icloud">IOS 15 &amp; iCloud</h2>
<p>Apparently Apple no longer allows you to login to an iCloud account if your device is not on the latest IOS version (or at least IOS 15). I&rsquo;m not sure when this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; was implemented, but I can&rsquo;t find any news articles about this topic so they must&rsquo;ve added it in silently. I found this out when trying to login to my icloud account on a recently purchased iPhone SE 1st gen, I planned to use for a upcoming video idea. As you can see in the footage I recorded, you cannot login to an existing account, even after going through the setup process. Trying to create one, requires a phone number no matter what options you choose, and that doesn&rsquo;t even guarantee it letting you login if you choose to add a number to the account. Essentially, this means your device is limited to very basics activities until you choose to update.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No access to icloud features like photos, storage etc.</li>
<li>No Apple Music</li>
<li>No access to downloading apps in the app store<br>
and probably more I&rsquo;m forgetting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="its-for-security-right">It&rsquo;s For Security, Right?</h2>
<p>Okay Extremos, They must be doing it for better security and I like my devices protected. why should I care about this? Yes, we all care about security too, but some also like to have the freedom of not being forced new content down our throat. Lets take a flashback to the iPhone 4s and how it ran on IOS 9, That device runs slower than my toaster. Now imagine if every iPhone 4s were forced to upgrade to IOS 9, it&rsquo;d be a catastrophe and would&rsquo;ve basically considered all of them as a brick. If Apple keeps going down this road, we will have even less choice with the devices we pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for.</p>
