<p><em>Video is not uploaded/completed yet</em></p>
<p><em><strong>A disclaimer for anyone that hasn’t played the storyline of this video game yet: I will not be going into too much detail of the story, characters or anything related besides my experience with the performance and visuals.

<p>Saints Row the Third, a game with a story everyone should play through at least once. But is it worth grabbing this game since its soon to be older than most the people watching this video? Well, that’s a dumb question, of course you should, the age of a game shouldn’t affect whether you do or do not play it, but where is the most convenient to purchase and play? Is convenience making the experience you have worse off than not playing at all? Having played Saints Row 3 originally on the Playstation 3 I think around release day, sometime in the month, and now recently playing through the remastered edition on PC through the Epic Games Store &amp; Steam with friends, I wanted to have this game at an easy to access place, where one can be taking a dump and eating ramen at the same time. (Consider recording a skit of this). Well, where else is better than the Nintendo Switch? Well, almost anywhere else really, but that’s not my review.</p>
<h2 id="reading-reviews"><strong>Reading Reviews</strong></h2>
<p>As I do for almost all Nintendo Switch games I’m interested in trying, I watch a review from other YouTubers to see what the gameplay is like and how it holds on such an aging brick of hardware. Turns out, it wasn’t reviewed very well initially, with many bugs &amp; performance issues causing reviewers to dislike this port. There was a patch somewhere along the line that supposedly fixed a good amount of the frame rate issues, so I picked up the game for $10 on sale in the eShop and began the journey of this game’s odd odd story once more.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-beforehand"><strong>Expectations Beforehand</strong></h2>
<p>My expectations going in were not high, acknowledging that aiming a weapon with a joy con is like trying to pin the tail on the donkey at your brothers 10th birthday party, and your Aunt’s boyfriend is the donkey. Another big factor I had swimming through my head was the difference in frame rate coming from PC, hollowing down between 30-45fps. It’s slightly annoying that they didn’t just cap the frame-rate to 30fps because if there are any hitches you come along, and you will, you’ll most definitely feel it and can cause headache. Another thing to consider would be the graphics quality, what did the developers have to sacrifice to get the consistent 30fps? Being on such a smaller screen because of the handheld experience, quality can be lowered a decent amount and still look good, but did the developers step too far and is docked mode looking more like the video-game “Claybook”.</p>
<h2 id="frame-rate"><strong>Frame-rate</strong></h2>
<p>Playing through the first mission gave some good relief, as the lowered frame-rate wasn’t actually too bothering. It was noticeable don’t get me wrong, but it’s something that you should be able to get used to quite easily. If players could enjoy 30fps on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, you can too so suck it up. The majority of Nintendo Switch ports lower their frame rate to 30fps so this is something that honestly all Nintendo Switch users should expect in 2022. This would be fine and dandy, IF there weren’t also frame drops to factor in. If there is a large amount of entities on the screen or you blow up too many items at once, or drive too fast, you will notice the frame rate dip below the 30-45fps mark the game aims for, or at least varies between the two numbers often enough to make the experience jumpy-like, disorientating.</p>
<h2 id="graphics-quality"><strong>Graphics Quality:</strong></h2>
<p>I can’t give praise as easily while talking about the graphics though, as you probably already noticed from the background footage playing. How you’re interpreting the graphics on your display is how it would look if you played it for yourself in docked mode. I’m torn because the experience in docked mode (on a tv at least) is better than handheld because you’re most likely positioned farther from the screen, making the pixelation harding to see. I can’t speak for how it would look and feel if played on the smaller switch lite, but with the switch OLEDs bigger screen and being heavy enough where holding it away from you is slightly irritating after longer play sessions, the jagged edges are very noticeable and can be a turnoff for some. But if you’re going to play only docked, buy this game on a console or PC! The jagged edges aren’t completely gone from playing docked and are still well-visible, especially compared to other devices playing this game. Attempting to play on a 1440p resolution monitor or TV would only make the situation worse, because of the Switch lacking 1440p resolution support.</p>
<p>For some people, a lowered graphical experience isn’t a problem, it’s generally accepted for most Switch games, and is up to the persons discretion. To help any of you watching and trying to decide, here’s a side-by-side comparison of the lovely drive through Steelport in the mission “Steelport here I Am”. (Insert the video here, edit this line of text to make it sound better if need be, I can’t word it over text for some reason).</p>
<p><strong><strong>Traffic Density:</strong></strong></p>
<p>Another side note before talking about the controls, I wanted to point out that there might be a lesser amount of traffic in this port, which can be a problem when trying to do activities like Insurance Fraud or missions like Tank Mayhem. I seemed to have difficulties with vehicles spawning during these events on PC as well, but not as noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="controls"><strong>Controls</strong></h2>
<p>If I want to play a first person shooter or any game that requires aiming at a target, I despise the idea of using a controller, no matter the platform. Keyboard and mouse will always be superior and that’s that, but some platforms have a feature that makes it less irritating, using motion controls. Thankfully you can use that here with the joycons, meaning once you’ve held down the aim button, simple rotate the device around and hope to get a better aim than what the aim-assist could’ve given you. Never having used this type of thing before, It took me a few hours to get comfortable with it and utilize it rather than fight against it and consider disabling it. Once I got the hang of it though, I really enjoyed the shooting mechanic and was excited for the next mission.</p>
<p>There are a few noticeable areas where I still wished I was using a Keyboard and mouse, mostly when there are lots of enemies in the area and they can aim faster than you can, or when using the sniper rifle for any missions, one mission in specific being “Guardian Angel”. Man, good luck sniping with the motion controls. Not only is it motion controls, the joystick moves slower when motion controls are enabled. This isn’t just for sniping it’s for all weapons, but it’s terrible when needing pinpoint accuracy and expecting the stick to move you farther than it does. Even better, for this mission the camera is swayed to convey the feeling that you’re dangling off the building like your character is, so your having to un-scope and rescope to fix your gyro location or else your in positions you didn’t know your body could make.</p>
<h2 id="other-handheld-options"><strong>Other Handheld Options</strong></h2>
<p>So let’s say you aren’t interested in the switch port anymore after watching this video, are you out of luck trying to play this goofy title on the go? No actually, being in the year 2022 there has been such a boom of new portable handhelds releasing and being announced. The biggest and most well heard of as of recent would be the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The steam deck can play Saints Row 3 with the high settings option selected at a stable 60fps basically no problem, and can maintain and decent 30-45fps 1080p when docked. Now sure, you can say that the Steam Deck costs more than the Nintendo Switch or that it’s not as easily available to purchase for yourself compared to the Nintendo Switch. If you were to purchase the cheapest Steam Deck option with the equivalent amount of storage as the Nintendo Switch OLED, the price different is only $50. Availability was a problem for the Nintendo Switch as well believe it or not, especially once COVID came along and Animal Crossing released. The price of a Nintendo Switch on eBay was going for around $700, easily double the MSRP.</p>
<p>I’m not going to even start wandering into the conversation about other handhelds from companies like AyoNeo or Ayn because there are just so many. But I can guarantee you will find a handheld comparable to the Nintendo Switch with better performance, and with a cheaper price tag in 2023, if not already in 2022.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up"><strong>Wrap up</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, we’ve reached the point to explain my TLDR. Should you play Saints row the Third on the Nintendo Switch, was it a decent enough port to make it worth its price? After completing another play-through of the storyline, I found myself swaying away from doing almost all of the unnecessary missions or activities like finding collectables and taking photographs with fans because I didn’t enjoy driving through the world as much as I did on PC. My brain decided it would be more of a hassle to drive around and do the activities with the jumps in frames and less intuitive aiming than it would be to simply ignore them and play the storyline. But when it came to completing the missions for the story and experiencing it again, in a nice portable form, I must’ve had a good enough time because I completed it in around 3 days.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to play on a different platform like the Playstation 4, 5, Xbox consoles, another handheld device, or even better PC where you can add mods and save files if that’s something you like doing, then that’s most definitely the better path to follow. If you didn’t know that already, you must be new to the Switch. But if you are interested in the portable aspect, or just don’t have any alternative platform to play, then I still had a blast and think it’s worth picking up when on sale. The games MSRP price on the switch eShop is $40, and seeing that it is not the remastered edition with the expanded graphics options, and this game originally releasing in 2011, you should only pick it up when on sale or for a lesser price on places like eBay or BestBuy. Myself, only paying $10, I think it was a $10 well spent.</p>
<p>I do hear Saints row 4 runs better than the third on the switch, so I’ll probably make a video reviewing it the next time it goes on sale. That too, is $40 and it has been seen as low as $2.49 before so do not pay full price for that one either.</p>
