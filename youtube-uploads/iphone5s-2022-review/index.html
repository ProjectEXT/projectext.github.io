<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Another day, another iphone from eBay. This time though, this device was bought from a trusted buyer that I&rsquo;ve good experience with in the past.</p>
<p>only costing me roughly $20 free shipping. If the item was considered to be in good condition, they&rsquo;d normally sell for $60 (That&rsquo;s a big price difference). This listing though, stated there were issues with the LCD (the screen). Looking at all of the photos, there aren&rsquo;t any signs that I can see that would concern me about issues with the LCD screen &amp; figured maybe they&rsquo;re just being picky with their item conditions &amp; wanting to be more safe than sorry when selling.</p>
<h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2>
<p>It came in a plain-white box with little to no packaging to protect the device inside, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to get damaged so that&rsquo;s good. Immediately, I scrubbed this thing down with some lysol wipes, this device looked like it was ran over by a country-side farmer or something. I&rsquo;d love to know the story behind this device. Most of the icky goo stuff didn&rsquo;t come off on the first scrub, but I got the rest off after recording.</p>
<p>Trying to turn on the device after plugging it into my powerbank, it wouldn&rsquo;t turn on whatsoever. This is a well-known issue with apple devices that have poor battery life &amp; require the wall-power&rsquo;s UHMPF to get it to spark to life.</p>
<h2 id="initial-boot">Initial Boot</h2>
<p>When the device decided to show it cared about me, first thing I noticed was it&rsquo;s already been through the setup process. Checking to make sure nobody&rsquo;s account was still logged in, the screen looks like a vintage TV - if any of you remember what those look like, they probably looked better than this in white light. It&rsquo;s not as noticeable when not using white-colored applications, but there&rsquo;s definitely some burn-in. Comparing it to the iPhone SE from my last video, the iPhone 5s&rsquo;s age is starting to show.</p>
<p>Capacity is 16gb which matches the ebay listing so that&rsquo;s good, and running ios 12.1.3 which isn&rsquo;t the latest so thats kind of cool. For testing out the speakers, we gave our friendly internet-neighbor Rick a good visit, sounding fresher than ever. The headphone jack even works this time!</p>
<h2 id="the-test-of-time">The Test of Time</h2>
<p>I wanted to see if the device would die or become worse overtime, so I decided to use it as a mediaplayer, spotify listener for a couple weeks. I had a little scare the first week&hellip;. Turns out it was my tablet, guess it&rsquo;s good I don&rsquo;t use it often. Overall though, it works amazingly for what it is, a 7 year old phone at this point. Don&rsquo;t expect it to outmatch, or even compare to any newer device in 2021 - it shouldn&rsquo;t be used for anything more than basic tasks like phone calls &amp; listening to music etc. With that said though, it&rsquo;s still a beefy phone especially for it&rsquo;s size &amp; age.</p>
<p>Besides the slightly burned-in screen, I can&rsquo;t see any reason to mark this item listing as &ldquo;for parts or not working&rdquo;. The seller could be making lots more profit from their listings, but maybe they know that &amp; want to give these phones to good homes knowing anybody buying parts are probably worth selling them to. I might add the ebay seller in the description if you&rsquo;re looking to pickup yourself any classic phones or devices &amp; want to find one at a great price in pretty good condition.</p>
