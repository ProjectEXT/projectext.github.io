      <description>Inititally written Feb 14, 2022, Uploaded Mar 6, 2022 Introduction Should you is a question too many people ask before even considering why they&amp;rsquo;re asking. But for some it feels impossible to get anywhere without asking, so I&amp;rsquo;m here today to hopefully answer your questions about whether its worth your time fixing older devices on your own, especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t plan to update them to the latest OS version.</description>

      <description>Feb 14, 2022 Good morning. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to do this video, feeling it was very basic and little helpful for anyone else out there when it comes to the topic of ad blocks etc. But I decided hey, if it helps one other person, then my time wasn&amp;rsquo;t wasted.
Nobody likes ads, which is why most of us use an ad-blocker when we watch youtube and simply whitelist the channels we want to watch ads on to appreciate their work.</description>

      <description>Jan 26, 2022 Introduction Something useful to know before watching, Awhile back, Apple was reportedly slowing down older iPhone&amp;rsquo;s for reasons they claimed to save battery health &amp;amp; were eventually fined for doing this. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything about this, you should google up some articles about it before watching this video, because then whats coming up will make more sense.
IOS 15 &amp;amp; iCloud Apparently Apple no longer allows you to login to an iCloud account if your device is not on the latest IOS version (or at least IOS 15).</description>

With that said, this video will show you the basics of how to install BetterDiscord &amp;amp; what plugins I recommend are basically a necessity.
Start by heading to BetterDiscord&amp;rsquo;s official website. All links will be in the video description as well.</description>

      <title>How to Change Halo Infinite&#39;s Long Loading Screen</title>

      <description>Jan 5, 2022 So awhile back, a couple months ago by the time I got around to writing this script, I posted a random video about Halo Infinite&amp;rsquo;s annoyingly long intro on my second channel. I didn&amp;rsquo;t put lots of effort into the video, even though I knew it would be gain some traction because at the time I was pretty sick and couldn&amp;rsquo;t care. My only real regret is not putting it on the main channel.</description>

      <title>Buying an iPhone 5S in 2022: Is It Worth It?</title>
      <link>https://hobbysalike.com/youtube-uploads/iphone5s-2022-review/</link>

      <description>Jan 4, 2022 Introduction Another day, another iphone from eBay. This time though, this device was bought from a trusted buyer that I&amp;rsquo;ve good experience with in the past.
only costing me roughly $20 free shipping. If the item was considered to be in good condition, they&amp;rsquo;d normally sell for $60 (That&amp;rsquo;s a big price difference). This listing though, stated there were issues with the LCD (the screen). Looking at all of the photos, there aren&amp;rsquo;t any signs that I can see that would concern me about issues with the LCD screen &amp;amp; figured maybe they&amp;rsquo;re just being picky with their item conditions &amp;amp; wanting to be more safe than sorry when selling.</description>

      <description>Sept 27, 2021 I buy a lot of stuff on eBay, most of the time items I think I can flip &amp;amp; make some money, or simply just want to keep around or actually use. So when I saw this listing for an iPhone SE with little-to-no description on what specs are inside starting at $1, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. (It did get up to $20 because some other dude tried outbidding me but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t letting that happen shh).</description>

      <title>COD Vanguard: Beta - Another Call of Duty</title>
      <link>https://hobbysalike.com/youtube-uploads/cod-vanguard-review/</link>

      <guid>https://hobbysalike.com/youtube-uploads/cod-vanguard-review/</guid>
      <description>Sept 18, 2021 The first call of duty beta I played was back during the start of Black ops 3, it was the first beta I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played I think. Since then, i&amp;rsquo;ve taken part in most other&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; enjoying what I can from them. This year is no different, with Call of duty Vanguard being right around the corner. My opinions on this game in it&amp;rsquo;s beta state aren&amp;rsquo;t anything special, but stick around if you want to here some banter about a game you probably don&amp;rsquo;t care about.</description>

      <description>Oct 11, 2021 Introduction Sonic adventure 2 was born &amp;amp; released on June 19, 2001 in NA, making this game almost old enough to drink. Quick disclaimer, this video isn&amp;rsquo;t anything like a review, I won&amp;rsquo;t be going in depth about its gameplay or anything like that. With that out of the way, lets talk about what this game holds &amp;amp; how it holds up in 2021.
Sonic Adventure 2 is kind of known to be one of the best 3D sonic games, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t say much for the rest of the series.</description>
