      <description>Introduction Video is not uploaded/completed yet
A disclaimer for anyone that hasn’t played the storyline of this video game yet: I will not be going into too much detail of the story, characters or anything related besides my experience with the performance and visuals. There will be background video that may contain cutscenes or are from missions in the game, but should mostly be spoiler free.
Saints Row the Third, a game with a story everyone should play through at least once.</description>

      <description>Feb 14, 2022 Good morning. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to do this video, feeling it was very basic and little helpful for anyone else out there when it comes to the topic of ad blocks etc. But I decided hey, if it helps one other person, then my time wasn&amp;rsquo;t wasted.
Nobody likes ads, which is why most of us use an ad-blocker when we watch youtube and simply whitelist the channels we want to watch ads on to appreciate their work.</description>
