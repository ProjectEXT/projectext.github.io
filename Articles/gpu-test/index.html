<p>Before even reading this, let me answer your question you may be asking. The graphics card you should purchase is the one you can afford. If you can&rsquo;t afford the one you&rsquo;re looking into and it&rsquo;s a necessity to get a video card now, find one you can afford and settle with that for as long as possible. If it&rsquo;s not neccesary to grab that one in specific and you&rsquo;re looking for something more powerful, don&rsquo;t get anything until you can afford it. Hands down, that&rsquo;s the answer, stop making your poor brain do extra work processing the millions of possibilities between cards, oh should I get this, but this is better for a little more, etc.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t planning on making something like this until I was recently gifted a GTX 980ti for a server PC I plan to make. Before you say Extremos server pc&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t need gpus, yeah well mine does for stupid shit like recording &amp; virtual machines. I always thought as the number goes up in Nvidia cards, the better they will be. Wow, was I wrong &amp; surprised with the results. How does the 980ti (going for around $200) compare to video cards one generation above the 9 series, the gtx 1050ti for around $130 and the gtx 1060 6gb for $170 ish in 2022.</p>
<p>With the help of a few friends over a discord call, we benchmarked to the best of our special brains abilities with a handful of games that the casual gamer might play. Please do not take these results as scientific or anything, leave those things to the proper youtubers like Gamers Nexus or LTT. We&rsquo;re here for fun ;). All benchmarks are done paired with an i7 10700k and 16gb of ram running on a 1440p monitor.</p>
<p>First game is Borderlands 3 on Baddass Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>1050ti: 13.64fps</li>
<li>1060:   26.21fps</li>
<li>980ti:   40.56fps</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on the list is Minecraft with Shaders, specifically kuda shaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>1050ti: 34fps</li>
<li>1060:   56fps</li>
<li>980ti:   80fps</li>
</ul>
<p>Halo Infinite on ultra settings with share screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>1050ti: 37fps</li>
<li>1060:   69fps</li>
<li>980ti:   78fps</li>
</ul>
<p>And for last, the city builder Cities Skylines with share screen:</p>
<p>When zoomed out and paused/ Not paused and zoomed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>1050ti: 42.5 fps / 24fps</li>
<li>1060:   70fps / 46fps</li>
<li>980ti:   70fps / 45fps</li>
</ul>
<p>Last couple things to add, the 1050ti and 1060 kept at an alright temp in all games sitting around 72-83 Celsius. The 980ti on the other hand, had those fans pumped at max in almost any situation possible and got up to the 90s Celsius in certain games like Halo Infinite and Cities Skylines. To be fair to the poor card, it barely fit&rsquo;s in my case with my radiator mounted in the front. It&rsquo;s a chunky boy.</p>
<p>So, like I said, none of this is scientific at all, but some of this can be taken as a &ldquo;what would happen in real world situations&rdquo; benchmark. Well, if we wanted to say realistic, realistically nobody should be expecting crazy fast results on these cards while playing at ultra quality in 2022. But, as we can tell from the numbers, the 980ti and in some cases even the 1060 is still a beast to this day for 1440p 60fps. With the 1050ti costing only a little under the 1060 in most situations, it just doesn&rsquo;t perform well enough for it to be a card I can recommend nowadays. The 1060 also seems to be showing it&rsquo;s age pretty good as well, but it could still kick some ass from time to time. My TLDR would be, between these cards I fiddled around with, if you can find a gtx 980ti for around $150-$200, then it&rsquo;s the best option in this bundle.</p>
