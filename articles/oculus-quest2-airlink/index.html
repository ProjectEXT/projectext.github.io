The other day, I was watching a Spawncast Live-stream late at night and one of the conversations were asking how the Oculus Quest 2 &amp;amp; PC would compare to the upcoming PSVR 2 and a PS5. The overall opinion was PSVR would be better because connecting to PC was either difficult or expensive, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly true. For this video, I want to show you guys how to use an Oculus quest 2 wireless with Air Link and how it performs with games mentioned like Half Life: Alyx." />

<p>The other day, I was watching a Spawncast Live-stream late at night and one of the conversations were asking how the Oculus Quest 2 &amp; PC would compare to the upcoming PSVR 2 and a PS5. The overall opinion was PSVR would be better because connecting to PC was either difficult or expensive, but that isn&rsquo;t exactly true. For this video, I want to show you guys how to use an Oculus quest 2 wireless with Air Link and how it performs with games mentioned like Half Life: Alyx.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing for most people watching this video, this is either your first time setting up your VR headset or the first time trying to connect it to PCVR through the Oculus app. If you don&rsquo;t have the oculus app already installed, you can download it from their website with the link in the description, run the exe and go through the first couple steps. It&rsquo;ll eventually ask you what headset you own, and obviously click the headset you own. keep in mind, Oculus Quest 2 is the only one that can do air link hence why this video is surrounded around that headset. After choosing, it will ask you how you want to connect the headset to your PC. From there, just use common sense and you&rsquo;re done. It&rsquo;s that simple, and if you want to play Steam VR games, it&rsquo;s basically the same stuff. Install SteamVR from the steam store, open it when finished and blam you&rsquo;re instead Steam&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>How does it run compared to other headsets or even ones that aren&rsquo;t released yet? Well, this varies depending on your WiFi&rsquo;s capabilities and speed. For me, I get 217 gigabit down and 11 up, so I have plenty of head-room to max out the latency for air link to use. The minimum recommended would be 100, but even then aim for higher. How do games play? It&rsquo;s on PC, if your PC is specked well enough compared to consoles then it&rsquo;ll play them better than consoles in most situations.</p>
