Before even reading this, let me answer your question you may be asking. The graphics card you should purchase is the one you can afford. If you can&amp;rsquo;t afford the one you&amp;rsquo;re looking into and it&amp;rsquo;s a necessity to get a video card now, find one you can afford and settle with that for as long as possible. If it&amp;rsquo;s not neccesary to grab that one in specific and you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something more powerful, don&amp;rsquo;t get anything until you can afford it.</description>

The other day, I was watching a Spawncast Live-stream late at night and one of the conversations were asking how the Oculus Quest 2 &amp;amp; PC would compare to the upcoming PSVR 2 and a PS5. The overall opinion was PSVR would be better because connecting to PC was either difficult or expensive, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly true. For this video, I want to show you guys how to use an Oculus quest 2 wireless with Air Link and how it performs with games mentioned like Half Life: Alyx.</description>
